### Design is utility and significance
> Defined by John Heskett, a historian, this is a succinct way of saying that designed things should (1) exhibit pragmatism and (2) be simultaneously packed with expressive qualities

"Design is not just 'free-form experimentation' (art) and 'building a better mousetrap' (engineering). It's someplace in-between"[^1]

### Transform man's environment and tools
> The job of product design is to 'transform man's environment and tools and by extension man himself [^2]
>  #### Victor Papnek

### Design is imposing meaningful order
>  All people are designers. Design is a conscious effort to impose a meaningful order[^3]
>  #### Victor Papnek

### Design is deliberative planning which prefigures our actions and making
> Designing is fundamental to being human - we design that is to say we deliberately plan and scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and making. We design the world while our world acts back on us and designs us.[^3]
> #### Anne-Marie Willis

### Design is a mode of knowledge production that is abductive and speculative
> Design is abductive in that it is the best prediction given incomplete observations. It is speculative in that it envisions as well as manipulates the future[^3]
> #### Sasha Constanza-Chock

### Design as a noun and a verb
> All humans design, not everyone gets paid to do so
> #### Sasha Constanza-Chock

The contemporary use of the word design can fall into two categories:[^3]
1. As a noun it is a "highly professional field of practice...a way of manipulating future objects and systems using specialized software"
2. As a verb, it is "a universal kind of human activity...an everyday use of traditional knowledge embedded in indigenous lifeways"

### The politics of one world becoming the constraints on another
> Design is the process by which the politics of one world becomes the constraints on another[^4]
> #### Fred Turner

### Changing the problem to find the solution
> Design can be seen as the iterative process of changing the problem to find the solution[^5]
> #### Sasha Constanza-Chock

### Changing existing conditions into preferred ones
> Design offers the means to devise course of action aimed at changing existing conditions into preferred ones[^6]
> #### Herbert Simon

### A practice for things to attain desired functions and meanings
> Design is a culture and a practice concerning how things ought to be in order to attain desired functions and meanings[^6]
> #### Ezio Manzini

### A capacity to propose new sites as political
> Design's capacity to propose new kinds of bodies, entities, and sites as political[^8]
> #### Dominguz Rubio and Fogue

### Design takes place at the edges of social theory
> Design takes place at the edges of social theory[^7]
> #### Arturo Escobar

Theories of power, theories of change, history and philosophy of technology, theories of making and designing, contextual studies are all relevant fields of study for design
