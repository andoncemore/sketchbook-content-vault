The key ideas presented in this book start from the premise that there are fundamental [[disability is a misfit between the body and the world|misfits between the body and the world]], some of which are considered disabilities. Each chapter of the book looks at these misfits at different scales, examining how people and communities adapt themselves and how they make the built environment bend to their bodies. Through these stories, she makes the argument that [[our bodies are produced by the social, material world]].

Through these narratives, Sara Hendren introduces key questions at the intersection of disability, technology, and design, asking [[what counts as technology]], [[statistical thinking led to the emergence of normal | who counts as normal]], and [[independence as self-determination | what does independence mean]]? 

She asks us to look closely at how [[tools-in-use have a social significance]] by thinking from a [[use-centered perspective of technology]] to understand and reflect on these questions. As approaches to design, she introduces the ideas of [[universal design]] and [[adaptive or diffuse design]].

Finally, the book closes on important ideas about what a life worth living looks like, challenging normative ideas of [[the clock as a measure of productivity | productivity]], efficiency, and capitalism through a deep and personal exploration of [[crip time]].
