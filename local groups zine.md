Interesting things from local groups


Anyone know what the drone flying over are about? Is it for fire prevention? 
- Rumors are that it's home insurance companies
- Could it be realtors? Appraisers? Surveyors?
- A guy wearing a utility vest set off a drone in front of my house. He said he worked for the city and was inspecting the power poles. He said they do this routinely for maintenance reasons
 

Anyone else ashamed of the eyesore US Post Office at Main & Spring? I look at Federal facilities in other communities and don't see eyesore properties like this PO. Every couple of years they pay a fortune to landscapers to clean it up, plant new plants, trim and fix irrigation - then within months it turns into an eyesore again because of lack of ongoing maintenence. I recently filed a complaint online and can't wait to see what happens. I know others have complained to the management of this PO as well. I'm just tired of X Town getting the short end of the stick
- 73 comments
- Had the same issue in Town Y. Ppl finally got tired of it. Folks donated plants and money and volunteers handled it. Good luck
- This isn't meant to be a comparison but the Town Z water district landscape has been neglected for a couple of years now, some plants are way over grown and others are just dead. I don't know what happened because landscape used to be maintained on a regular basis
- It's been a total mystery to me for years. I would like to know the reason why it is so derelict. 
- Yes!! I agree. The plywood covering the smashed windows, the nasty, dirty entrance mat, and the car smash and grab thefts have been going on too long. I will email my comments to the higher ups.
- UPDATE: Contacted by Post Office same day at 4:30pm to be told the matter is being forwarded to the Post Master responsible for several facilities in the area


Long shot... I just lost $200 (in $20s) between the Chase ATM on X street and Y street. I retraced my steps. This would have been around 3:45-4:15. If you found it, having it back would be great. I need it for bills!
- Hi! Did you walk on C street?
    - I did. Down X street on the Taco stand side.
- UPDATE: a bright moment in my weird day. Thanks neighbor!


Roofing question: Question for homeowners -- I had a roof replaced about ten years ago with a 5 year warranty. Last year I noticed that it sounded like there was a leak but I could hear it but not see it. My question is: is there a test that roofers can do to pinpoint a tiny leak? I would pay for it of course, I'm just worried that if I don't get that test, any roofer will just say "oh replace it."
- Roofers hate trying to find and fix leaks. It's their needle in a haystack. You can run a hose for hours without any issues but then a light drizzle will drip. Best you can do is have a qualified roofer do a complete inspection. They'll just fix any suspicious spots and then it's just wait and see what happens in the next rain. Try XYZ Roofing. 
- ABC Roofing does leak inspections. I've found them trustworthy


Hi everybody! Please come and bring some flowers for this ofrenda Go dodgers!
- Love it!!
- What is an ofrenda?
    - It's an altar for the Day of the Dead (Dia de Los Muertos), in which family members or loved ones put the deceased person's favorite food or drink and maybe photos of them or other items from their lives
