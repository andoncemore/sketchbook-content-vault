# Kalugumalai Riots: a historical and ancestral perspective 

On October 16th we traveled to Kalugumalai to trace some dark pages in our family history. Of course the place to start was to learn more about the 1895 Kalugumalai riot. This was the sentinel event that affected and upended the lives of our grandparents and great-grandparents. This was the Big Bang event that set in motion the trajectory for many of our lives in the future. To understand the event, we need to know about the background history of the Nadar community and their relationship to the rest of the communities who lived in the area.

## Background History on Caste

Father George has vividly written about the state of affairs in the 1890's in his book titled "The Growth and Revolts." This book reads like the Nadar community had the best of times and worst of times during those years. In 1891, Kalugumalai was a small hamlet with a population of 3,800 people. Out of this 500 were Nadars, 475 Maravars, 400 Chettiars, 350 Vellalars, and the rest were other smaller communities. In the Hindu caste system hierarchy, the Nadars were considered as inferior to other caste Hindus. This pecking order was usually setup by the ruling class of the time. The Ettayapuram Zamin was in the hands of the Nayakkars who had also ruled the old Pandiyan kingdom for more than hundred years from Madurai. Backed by the ruling class the other communities availed themselves of many privileges which were denied to the Nadars. For example, they were not allowed to enter the temple or use the water from temple pond. By the 1800's the power had passed onto the British East India company and then to the British Government.

The caste hierarchy made Nadars resentful of the inferior status accorded to them, and they demanded equality. They wanted dignity and equal rights. They wanted equal access to the temple car streets to take their wedding palanquins in procession. They wanted rights to enter the temple and worship their Gods.

### Impact of British Rule

Since 1801, the British had gained administrative control of South India. The feudal wars between the warlords had been expunged and relative peace prevailed in the land. But the British rulers had setup a policy of not shaking the boat too much by not interfering to change old traditions and customs. Their goal appeared to be to keep the peace and collect the revenue to line their pockets. But this period offered a time for the Nadars to expand their trade skills and improve their educational opportunities. Those who had been suppressed for centuries by the ruling class now had opportunities for progress. In particular, the European missionaries were eager to help them. They provided some initial funding and setup schools to educate these downtrodden, poor people. The Nadar community made substantial progress during this time. They became experts in setting up retail businesses and developed trading routes for their small businesses. However, they didn't participate in the government or it's administrative structure. Instead, they developed their own systems to manage their social and financial affairs.

One such system was a voluntary tax called 'Mahamai' to fund their social and educational activities. Blocked from going into the Hindu temple, they built their own temples that were entirely controlled by the Nadar community. Even as they accumulated wealth, they still were looking for social status which was not accorded to them by their jealous neighbors. Nadars became very resentful that they were still considered as inferior by the (upper?) caste Hindus. This resulted in multiple uprisings and revolts in Madurai, Ramnad, and Thirnelveli districts, where most of the Nadar communities lived.  One such revolt happened in Kalugmalai in 1895, where our ancestors lived at the time. 

We are going to look into the happenings here since our grandparents and great grandparents were in Kalugumalai as movers and shakers trying to change the traditions.

## Nadars in Kalugumalai

In the Nadar community of Kalugumalai at the time, one the key leaders was K.S Arunachala Nadar. Known as the Mudalali (boss) in town, he ran a cotton business from his warehouse on the main street across the Nadar's community center. He had a  close relationship to Father Baumal, S.J, a missionary working in Kalugumalai - his warehouse was often used as a bible school. Arunachala Nadar was very active in carrying out various litigation cases filed in jurisdictions of Tirunelveli, Tuticornin, and Chennai high court demanding equal rights for Nadars to use the temple streets. He conducted these court cases and other public affair in close association with the missionaries.

*We found records for one of these cases which showed the Madras High Court levying a penalty of Rs.1000 for court expenses. There is documentation of Arunachala Nadar making this payment at the Tuticorin Munsiff court when it was due.*

*We also found a signed letter from Arunachala addressed to foreign donors with a plea for help to compensate the financial losses the Nadar community suffered due to riots.* 

We wanted to know as much as possible about this heroic, larger than life figure because his daughter, Kaliammal, was OUR GRANDMOTHER!

### Kaliammal and Ponnusamy Nadar

Let's familiarize ourselves with our family tree before we dive into the details of the riot itself. Kaliammal was the oldest daughter of Arunachala Nadar. Kaliammal married Ponnusamy Nadar sometime around 1895. We can only speculate that they might have wished their wedding procession with the palanquin went through all the temple care streets, but this could not happen based on the rules of that time. 

Ponnusamy Nadar was the son of one Ayyappa Nadar in smaller nearby village of Chinnakalampatti. Based on our research, his family appeared to be a land holding, well-to-do group in that village. We speculate that they must have already had a marital relationship with Arunachala Nadar because Arunachala Nadar was described as the maternal uncle of Ponnusamy Nadar in one of the court documents we uncovered. 

Mangayarkarasi amma admired and respected Kaliammal. She used to say that Kaliammal grew up in very wealthy family and did not want to move to the small village of Chinnakalampatti after her wedding. So, the tradition was reversed and the groom moved to Kalugumalai instead. This must not have been difficult for Ponnusamy Nadar since he was just moving into the big household of his maternal uncle.

*When we visited Kalugumalai, the town elders showed us the plot of land in which the new couple lived. The house we saw on our trip was a fairly newly built concrete building. The original house had been burned down during the riots.*

## Rewind back to 1300s

Let's return to the the history of South India that set the stage for the riots that left the Nadar community in Kalugumalai in a precarious state. 

**End of the Pandiyan kingdom**
The last Pandiyan king Sundara Pandiyan was killed by Malik Kafur who was the slave commander of a Delhi sultan around the year 1300. After his marauding raid Malik went back to Delhi to meet up with his dying sultan. Things were left in shambles in Madurai and the once great Pandiyan kingdom was forever extinguished.

**Vijaynagar Empire and Nayak Rule**
With constant internecine fighting this family group and their followers were pushed into the hinterlands by the successive Muslim invasion. Following this period the Vijayanagar empire rose in power to contain the Muslim conquest of South India. The Nayak commanders of Vijayanagar took control of Madurai and all the lands south of it. Subsequent rulers of Madurai like Thirumalai Nayakkar and Rani Mangammal ruled as independent kings freed from Vijayanagar control. During this period this land was divided into multiple ‘Palayams’ and given to family and relatives who collected the revenue and supported the king. During this period the Nadar community lived dispersed throughout the land totally dominated by this ruling class.

**British Rule**
This status continued till 1800, when the British vanquished the Nayakkar rule and established their control throughout all the lands in the south. The Palayams were replaced by administrative districts called Zamins. Our ancestral home Kalugumalai came under the Ettayapuram Zamin a fairly large district. Chinnakalampatti, from where Ponnusamy Nadar emerged, was outside this Zamin. With the British administration fully established there was relative peace in the land. The Nadar community thrived during this period since the ruling class had changed.


## Conflict in Kalugumalai

The Zamin had transferred the ownership of the lands around the temple in Kalugumalai to the Devasthanam or Temple trustees. The temple car streets and the palace grounds were constructed within these grounds. This set the stage for the primary conflict that caused the riots. The Nadar community, which had lived near the hills, was denied entry into the Kalukachala Moorthy temple. This included access to the temple car streets and the temple pond. 

During this time period, the Nadar community was targeted by European Missionaries for mass conversion to christianity. They found a receptive audience in Kalugumalai where this community has been denied equal rights and opportunities under the Ettayapuram Zamin.

The Nadar community had attempted at least three times to express and extend their rights to have wedding processions into the temple car streets just like other caste Hindu communities. The other caste communities rebuffed these efforts rather violently. Their relations became more strained when the Zamin took fourteen Nadar leaders of the community to court alleging that they were disrupting the peace and rule of law and order in the town. The Zamin and temple claimed that the Nadar’s were of inferior caste and they were polluting the sacrosanct status of the temple car street. 

The courts primarily were considering whether the concerned area was public or private property. In all instances the court decreed against the Nadars with the decree that these streets were private property. After multiple appeals in different courts, the Chennai High Court decision also went against Nadars and a heavy penalty of Rs.1000/ was levied to be paid in Tuticorin court to cover the court expense. Now Nadars had forced to consider other options than going to the courts. Their conclusion was to consider converting to Christianity.

### Conversion to Christianity 

This conversion was not due to any quest for spiritual salvation. They were looking for their social status and equal rights. Their demand to take their wedding procession with their palanquin was a symbolic quest for that dignity. When this was not attainable through the courts about 300 Nadars elected to convert to christianity. They had no remorse in leaving their ancestral religion to obtain their loftier goal of equal rights. The European missionaries who were welcoming them were a formidable force now on their side against the bigotry and power sources aligned against them.

In spite of the anger and alarm of the caste Hindus, the new Christians went on to build a new church for themselves with the help of the French Jesuit Father Caussenel right on the temple car street where access had been denied to them in the past. The situation became critical and was like a tinderbox that can explode at any moment. It did happen on a day of celebration for both the rival groups celebrating their own festivities.

## The Riots

On April 7th, 1985 the new christians were celebrating Palm Sunday. They had fabricated a ‘pandal’ in front of their church on the east car street. On the same day the famous “Panguni Uthiram” was being celebrated at the big Murugan Temple. Thousands of people gathered and prepared to pull the two temple cars all around along the car streets especially built for this occasion. 

When the Temple car reached the site of the christian Pandal the crowd wanted it to be dismantled to let the car go through. The christians had argued that there was enough space for the car to pass by even with the pandal in place. The manager of the Zamin with several other officials went to negotiate a compromise with the christians to accommodate. The Hindu crowd got agitated that even a negotiation was happening. The crowd surged towards the pandal and in the melee stones were thrown and scuffles broke out. 

During this agitated period the angry crowd went into the pandal. The manager got stabbed and died on the spot. Another official also was stabbed and died the next day. The crowd went berserk and burnt the Pandal as well as the new church. The Nadars who took shelter in the church had to flee eventually. After all this happened the police showed up and arrested the escaping Nadars. The crowd later went on to loot and burn all the houses in the Nadar’s quarters. At least 6 Nadars were killed in this murderous spree.


## Aftermath of the Riots

The subsequent court documents indicate the police had arrested the victims who had lost their homes and property to the looters. None of those who committed the crime were investigated and brought to justice. The police and the justice department officials were so corrupt and obviously incompetent they were thoroughly criticized and chastised by the Chennai high court in their final verdict. The two men, Karuthanna Nadar and Mahalinga Nadar who were convicted and condemned to death penalty in the sessions were finally released as innocent.

We found Ponnusamy Nadar's name in court documents suing the thugs and scoundrels who allegedly burnt down his house. I find it surreal to imagine Kaliammal and him standing and watching the dacoity happening with their own eyes. Their jewelry, pots, pans, and cattle were stolen from their home. Even though they had facts on their side, the perpetrators were let go and evil prevailed because of a supposed lack of evidence. It should me mentioned here that all the jurors belonged to the other caste Hindus with enmity towards Nadars. It was no jury trial by peers.  Like this case, all other court cases brought by the Nadars went to jury trial and got only adverse verdicts. 

Even though Ponnusamy Nadar's name was at the forefront of the court documents, it must have been Arunachala Nadar making all the moves from behind. Arunachala Nadar already had lots of experience with court proceedings in previous tussles with the Zamin. We also speculate that he must have provided the funds to cover the expenses involved in bringing a case to court.

Interestingly, this failed court case is the last piece of information we know about Ponnusamy Nadar. His life and other information about him remains a mystery. Still, he must have been held in reverence for decades by our family since two of his grandchildren were named after him. It is possible he may have relocated with the help of the missionaries to save himself from retribution. Similarly, Aruchachala Nadar also disappears from records after this court case. 

*The last document we could find with mention of Arunachala Nadar was a court document that listed him as a witness and recorded that he did not show up and was declared as absconding. When*

*In the list of forty Nadars that were listed for arrest after the riots, his name was third, right after two murder suspects. According to the records from the Chennai high court, all the suspects were released with a verdict of not guilty of all the charges. Arunachala Nadar was never arrested because we was in Tuticorin, beyond the reach of the corrupt local police.* 

We sadly don't hear much about his activities in Kalugumalai after this event. Still we can speculate that he remained a behind the scenes force, especially when Kaliammal eventually decided to uproot her family and move to Virudhunagar. 

## The Story Continues

The story continues with Kaliammal. By 1908 a widowed Kaliammal treks by foot with five small children leaving the horrors and vindictiveness of Kalugumalai and settles down in Virudhupatti. We speculate this move was initiated and helped by Jothiammal, the wife of the Kalugumalai Vaithiyar (doctor). This doctor had only recently settled in Virudhunagar helped by one Mathalai Nadar who helped in the move to bring the good doctor’s services to the growing town.

Kaliammal settled to put roots in the new town which consisted of mostly Hindu Nadars. We don’t know how much she was still devoted to Catholic doctrines. Her last child had been named **Anthony**. Unfortunately he passed away during his high school final year and was buried in the Catholic tradition in a Catholic burial ground. Kaliammal’s eldest son **Vedamanickam** married a catholic bride from Kalugumalai. But subsequently the rest of the children got married into mostly clannish Hindu families: **Narayana Nadar** married Mangayarkkarasi Ammal in the year around 1926.

To establish herself, Kaliammal loaned money that she must have brought with her during her move for interest, eventually settling to buy the house in Gurusamy kothan street. Kalugumalai vaithiyar family lived in the same street providing friendly support during these transactions.

Narayana Nadar had joined the family business as an employee and eventually working as a commission agent for them in Colombo. By 1935 he had established himself to start his own business. In short order he became a successful business man accumulating modest wealth and acquired a few properties. Kaliammal ran the joint family in her full control. 

By this time Kalugumalai had become a distant memory, and nobody wanted to talk about the past painful events. After the passing of Kaliammal, the three brothers went their own ways and we continued to live in the same house. 

## Investigating our History

If we had become interested to know about our history earlier, we would have had more success in uncovering this story by acquiring first or second hand information, but now we have crossed into the fifth generation. There had appeared to be a general reluctance in our family to learn more about the past, but this next generation appears to be more interested to investigate and learn more. Most of the information in this monograph has been gathered by Ayyappan, Sathyan, and Madhu. I am happy this information can be passed on to our grandchildren and their children. The relentless spirit and indomitable work ethic of our ancestors in the face of adversity set the foundation for progress in our own lives. 

### Retracing the steps today

There are still a lot of missing pieces to this puzzle. I am sure others in this quest will add their findings and opinions to complete this puzzle. We are very grateful to our folks still living in Kalugumalai and Chinnakalampatti who welcomed us into their streets and homes. We walked the streets once forbidden to our grandparents. The Kalugachala moorthy temple was open and welcoming us but we didn't have the time to go in. 150 years ago, they likely would not have let us in.
